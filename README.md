gradle-base-plugins
===================

Base plugins for Gradle projects and plugins developed by FIDATA.
They provide reasonable defaults and sane environment
for all our projects.

These plugins are highly opinionated and for internal use only.
They are not to be published to Maven Central or Gradle Plugins portal.
However, you are free to fork, modify or use it as example
according to [Apache v2.0 license](LICENSE.txt).

If you are contributing to other FIDATA plugins the best choice is
to join [FIDATA organization](https://github.com/FIDATA)
and use all available infrastructure
including [our Artifactory repository](https://artifactory.fidata.org/)
where these plugins live.

## `org.fidata.project` plugin

General, language-agnostic project.

### Lifecycle

Basic build lifecycle is `assemble` → `check` → `release`.

`assemble`, `check` and, also, `clean` tasks are provided by applied
`lifecycle-base` plugin.

`release` task is provided by applied [`de.gliderpilot.semantic-release`
plugin](https://github.com/FIDATA/gradle-semantic-release-plugin).

### Prerequisites Lifecycle

*   Applies [`org.fidata.prerequisites`
    ](https://github.com/FIDATA/gradle-prerequisites-plugin)
    providing tasks for dealing with prerequisites managed by Gradle,
    Bundler, NPM and similar tools.

    To report outdated Gradle dependencies
    [`com.github.ben-manes.versions` plugin
    ](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin) is used.

*   Configures `wrapper` task to specific Gradle version

### Dependency Resolution

*	Applies and configures [`com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin
    ](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Gradle+Artifactory+Plugin)

    Allows us to publish artifacts and build info to [FIDATA Artifactory
    ](https://artifactory.fidata.org/).

*   Turns off changing modules caching, so that SNAPSHOT dependencies
    are updated on each run

*   Configures dependency resolution changing [Ivy status
    ](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/terminology.html#status)
    from `release` to `milestone` for artifacts
    having pre-release labels in version

### Documentation

*	Applies and configures [`org.ajoberstar.git-publish` plugin
    ](https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git-publish)

	Allows to publish documentation to GitHub pages.

*	Provides `noJekyll` task that generates `.nojekyll` file to
	[turn off Jekyll processing
	](https://github.com/blog/572-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages)

### Code Quality

*	Provides `lint` task

    `check` task depends on all `Test` tasks and new `lint` task.

*	Applies [`codenarc` plugin
    ](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/codenarc_plugin.html)

*	Provides `codenarc` and `pmd` tasks that run all PMD and CodeNarc
    tasks respectively.

	Includes these tasks in execution list for `lint` task.

*	Provides `codenarcBuildSrc` task for `build.gradle` itself
	and accompanying Groovy scripts

*	Sets default configuration for all `codenarc` tasks

	Adds `disabledRules` property to each task, so that specific rules
	could be disabled per task.

### Artifacts Publishing

*	Applies [`signing` plugin
	](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html)

	By default, Java-based implementation of PGP is used. Secret keyring
	should be placed at GnuPG home in `secring.gpg` file.

	If you want to use GnuPG for signing, properties for this are already set.
	Switch can be made with [`signing.useGpgCmd()`
	](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#example_sign_with_gnupg).

*	Provides read-only `isRelease` and `changeLog` project properties
	for working with semantic release

*	Provides `publicReleases` project property used by other plugins

	Setting it to true turns on all public-release tasks: publishing
	artifacts to Maven Central, JCenter and so on.

	By default it is false.

### Reports

*	Provides read-only project properties:
	*	`reportsDir`
	*	`htmlReportsDir`
	*	`xmlReportsDir`
	*	`jsonReportsDir`
	*	`txtReportsDir`

*	Applies and configures `reporting-base` plugin

    Redirects all reports to `build/reports/<format>` directory.

	Known limitation: `gradle --profile` reports are not redirected.
	They stay in `build/reports/profile` directory for now.
	See https://github.com/FIDATA/gradle-base-plugins/issues/1

### Build Diagnostics and Troubleshooting

*	Applies plugins:
	*	[`project-report`
	    ](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/project_reports_plugin.html)

		Provides `projectReport` and other tasks.

	*	[`com.dorongold.task-tree`
	    ](https://github.com/dorongold/gradle-task-tree)

		Provides `taskTree` task. It is wonderful in troubleshooting
		task dependencies.

	*	[`cz.malohlava`](https://github.com/mmalohlava/gradle-visteg)

		Generates task dependency graph
		in [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) format.

*	Provides `inputsOutputs` task which generates reports about all task
	file inputs and outputs

All these tasks are put into `Diagnostics` group.

### Other features

*	Sets project's `group` to `org.fidata` if it hasn't been set already

*	Provides `license` property used by other plugins

	It should be set with [SPDX license identifier
	](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

*   Provides `generateChangelog` and `generateChangelogTxt` tasks
    that generate changelog in Markdown and text formats
    in `build/changelog` directory

    The main usage is to check generated changelog
    during release preparation to make sure that everything is correct.

*   Provides `tags` property used by other plugins

*	Applies [`nebula.contacts` plugin
	](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-contacts-plugin)

	Provides `contacts` extension.

### buildSrc projects

Plugin can be applied to buildSrc projects.
However, buildSrc projects can't have releases and documentation,
so all related features are turned off.
They also don't publish build info to Artifactory.

### Supported tools versions:

*	Requires Gradle >= 4.9

*	Built and tested with JDK 8

*   Requires GnuPG >= 2.1

    `gpg-agent` should have `allow-preset-passphrase` option turned on
    if GPG key with passphrase is used.
    It is usually achieved by adding this string
    into `gpg-agent.conf` file in GPG home directory.

## `org.fidata.base.jvm` plugin

Project which uses JVM-based language.
This plugin should not be applied manually.

Applies [`org.fidata.project` plugin](#orgfidataproject-plugin),
and also:

*	Applies [`java-base`
    ](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html)
	and [`java-library`
	](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_library_plugin.html)
	plugins

*   Provides `jvm` extension.
    This extension has one property `javadocLinks`.

    It contains links to external documentation
    used by `javadoc` and `groovydoc`.
    If a dependency is added automatically, its documentation is also
    added here automatically.
    Otherwise, you add link manually, like this:
    ```
    jvm.javadocLinks['com.example.super.cool.external.library'] = uri('https://example.com/javadoc/com/example/super.cool.external.library/1.0/')
    ```

*   Adds `mavenJava` publication (except when `org.fidata.plugin`
    is applied)

### Testing

*	Adds [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) dependency
	to `testImplementation` configuration

*	Adds and configures `functionalTest` source set and task
    which uses [Spock framework](https://spockframework.org/)

	Also adds
	[Spock Reports](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/spock-reports).

	JUnit is also available whenever Spock is.

### Artifact Publishing

*	Applies [`maven-publish` plugin
    ](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html)

	Configures Maven publication to Artifactory.

	Your `settings.gradle` should contain this row:
	```
	enableFeaturePreview('STABLE_PUBLISHING')
    ```

    to prevent the following error:

    ```
    org.gradle.api.InvalidUserDataException: Cannot configure the 'publishing' extension after it has been accessed.
    ```

	If `publicReleases` is on — configures publication to Maven Central.

*	If `publicReleases` is on — applies [`com.jfrog.bintray` plugin
	](https://github.com/bintray/gradle-bintray-plugin)
	and configures publication to JCenter

</tbody>
</table>

All properties except `gpgKeyPassphrase` are required. The plugin
won't work if they are not set.

# Development

This is self-applying plugin. That means that build script requires
the plugin itself (just compiled, not released to the repository).
So, if there are any errors during compilation or plugin applying,
Gradle build script just doesn't work.
If it is a compilation error, you can run `../gradlew build`
in `buildSrc` directory to figure out what's going on.

## Upgrading Gradle Version

Whenever new Gradle version is released, the way to upgrade is this:

1.  Read Release Notes and make necessary changes to the code
2.  Run `./gradlew stutterWriteLock`
3.  Run `./gradlew compatTest<new Gradle version>`
4.  Change Gradle version for `wrapper` task in plugin code
5.  Run `./gradlew wrapper && ./gradlew wrapper`
